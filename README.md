# Health Communication Campaign

## Overview
------------------------------------------
The importance of staying hydrated is often overlooked. We are often reminded to eat balanced meals, but reminders of drinking enough water are not as prioritized. A study in 2011 tracked and evaluated fluid intake---particularly water intake---of college students and concluded that the average intake of young adults was lower than the recommended amount. The study concludes in "there is an urgent need for tailored nutrition intervention targeting the young adults to improve their beverage choices." This health communication campaign aspires to promote water drinking and staying hydrated among young adults.

Together, the campaigns present the difference between a NARRATIVE vs INFORMATIVE approach to promoting hydration. Our video campaign takes the form of a NARRATIVE approach: a humorous 30-second script for a video aimed to entertain the young adult audience while informing them of the benefits of staying hydrated. Our INFORMATIVE approach presents a campaign of a series of posters with the goal of informing the viewer/reader of the importance of drinking water.

### NARRATIVE CAMPAIGN
We first turned to gpt-4 to generate a 30-second video script according to our prompting. The prompt was specific in its target audience and message:

>
> "Make a 30 second humurous script for a video targeting young adult audiences that encourages people to drink water and stay hydrated throughout the day. This script is one video out of a series of hydration campaigns conveying the same message in different styles. In this specific script depict a group of teenagers hiking the Appalachian Trail, with one of the teenagers obviously struggling and on the verge of passing out. They are cranky and want to leave. The friends then say something along the lines of "Here, have some water." They hand them the water and its apparent quenching qualities immediately uplift the teenager's energy and is now determined to finish the trail."

> "Imitate the style of Snicker's ads."

Along with this prompt, the gpt-4 set up was assigned a system role:

>
> "You are a marketing professional in the advertisement field."
